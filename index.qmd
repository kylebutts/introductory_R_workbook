# Preface {.unnumbered}

This "workbook" serves as an opinionated introduction to R for data science workflows. 
My goal is to introduce everything from first principles so that someone installing R for the first time can get up to speed.
While not a complete tour of all that R is able to do, with the "Introduction" part of the book, you shuld be able to complete my class assignments.

This book is intended to be used interactively! 
There are many exercises scattered throughout. 
Some are focused to help with comprehension, while others are meant to build your confidence in exploring data to answer questions.

For those of you who would like to learn more, the Intermediate and Advanced guides will be contain extra information that continues to build up your programming skills. 
These will take longer to complete, but will grow over time.

With that, we can continue to our first topic: getting your computer ready for installing R and a code-editor to work in.
